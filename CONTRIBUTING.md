## Contributing

Pull Requests and Issues welcome! If you're stumped by any of the steps below, I'd rather have half a patch than no patch at all. :)

For fixes and features:

* Fork it
* Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
* Ensure you've got development dependencies: (`bundle`)
* Ensure existing tests run: (`bundle exec rspec`)
* Make your changes, including new specs / regression tests
* Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
* Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
* Create new Pull Request
